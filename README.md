# Government portfolio content generator

australia.gov.au contains information about Government portfolios, which is manually maintained.

Directory.gov.au provides a way for agencies to manage this data themselves, and then publishes the information as open data.

This project will replace the manual maintenance with an automated build process that regenerates the content pages on australia.gov.au.
